                This was a personal project I did over the summer after learning about ChatGPT. I wanted
                to integrate the model with my personal notes, which led to me create my own website wrapper
                that fed in notes using the function call api, enabling GPT to query for related notes. These
                notes were sourced from a PineconeDB, which are uploaded as embeddings alongside text metadata
                using the binary applicaiton built in Rust.

                My first major project, where I implemented custom blocks and items in minecraft
                bedrock edition. Currently is widely used in the bedrock community, with 100+ github stars. I had 
                initially developed my very own version (CustomX), before partnering up with the only other similar type of project
                which we later open sourced.

                This was a summer long project that I worked on. Cylex was meant to be a minecraft server
                that would use the custom block and item features me and a couple friends created / popularized
                on a commerical server. It is around 30k lines of code (if that means anything to you), and follows
                generally good OOP practices.
