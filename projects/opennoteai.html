            A project I made when ChatGPT was starting to get popular. I wanted to connect
            ChatGPT to my notes, so I enabled it to do so by creating a website that wrapped 
            ChatGPT that allowed the AI to make queires for note information, which my backend then
            semantically searched for using vector embeddings in pinecone. I also developed an executable
            that would allow users to upload their notes to PineconeDB.

            I first need to take the users notes, and store them as embeddings that I could
            then search for using semantic search, so that ChatGPT could find them. In order to do that,
            I decided to make a Rust based application for my users. The first step was to create
            a Rust crate around the Pinecone HTTP Api, which I did. I focused a lot on designing this 
            properly. I've attached some example code below. You can find the project <a href="https://github.com/abimek/pinenut">HERE</a>

            The executable was a little simpler, but I did decide to overcomplicate it by using far too much
            async await and "optimization". This optimization probably made it slower to be honest, but here's an image.

        <p class="description">
            Since the websites users needed to login, and I needed to connect to ChatGPT,
            I decided to make a backend server in Go that would handle streaming tokens, querying
            Pinecone for embeddings based on ChatGPT's query, and user sessions / logging in. This
            can be found <a href="https://github.com/abimek/opennote">HERE</a>
