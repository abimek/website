        <p class="description">
            This was my incomplete Minecraft server. After having made CustomX, I wanted to use the custom 
            block and custom item features I had created to make a brand new server experience like never before seen.
            I designed the code for Cylex to be abstracted into two different sections as I was planning on 
            making it a network of multiple servers with different gamemodes. The first was CylexCore, which
            contained the code for the shared features between my severs, like ranks, adminstration management,
            database connection utilities, and other shared core code. The other one was for the specific SkyBlock
            gamemode, implementing skyblock specific features.
